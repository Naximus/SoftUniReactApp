# SoftUniReactApp
Project for SoftUni reactJs 

# The idea of the application is to be a closed app for a sports center that will be used when it is fully completed. 
There are 4 roles: Admin, Manager, Trainer, and Trainee. Trainees cannot register themselves, registration occurs after their visit to the center. 
The Trainer creates a Trainee in the app and provides them with access using a username and password.

The structure is as follows: The Admin can create Managers, Trainers, and Trainees, and has access to full information. 
The Manager creates Trainers and Trainees, and has access to full information on those below them. The Trainer creates 
Trainees and has access to full information on their clients. The Trainee can change basic information and view information such 
as their diet plan, goals, and purchased passes. Each Trainee has access to information about their visits and how many passes they have left.
